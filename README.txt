Work Pipeline:
1. Pull at the beginning of each work session.
2. Do work
3. if it compiles, you can commit.
4. commit at the end of each work session. 


Using GIT:

**ALWAYS PULL BEFORE YOU DO WORK**

    - this is to help prevent massive amounts of merge conflicts. 
    - Try to keep to your section of work. The broader the scope of changes, the more likely that we will have merge conflicts.

INSTRUCTIONS:

    -all commits should be done to the alpha branch, which can be accessed via the command 

    git checkout <Branch_Name>

    -After that command is run, check that you are in the correct branch using:

    git branch
